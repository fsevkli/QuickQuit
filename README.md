Welcome to the CSE Capstone Project for *QuickQuit*! This repository is the foundation for the capstone development effort.

## Project Overview
*QuickQuit* aims to provide a tool for users to exit certain situations quickly by using a browser extension. The extension should trigger actions based on an HTTPS request sent from a remote site, while also modifying the user's browsing history.

### Pre-Development Considerations for Exit Extension:
- The extension should react to an HTTPS request from a remote site.
- The extension should be able to modify the user's history to facilitate exiting or switching tasks efficiently.

## Project Structure

### **Tech Stack:**
The tech stack includes a modern web development stack, with a focus on clean design and functionality:

- **Web Server Options**:
  - **Apache**: Popular and well-supported, but has higher memory usage.
  - **Caddy**: Automatically handles HTTPS configuration and is lightweight, but lacks extensive documentation.
  - **Nginx**: Efficient, handles concurrent requests well, and is highly scalable. We’ve chosen Nginx for its speed, efficiency, and strong online documentation.

- **Website Design**:
  The goal is to create a clean, user-friendly website with a focus on user experience. We’re using a purple color palette to align with the cause of raising awareness for domestic violence, as purple is often used to represent this issue. This will establish a visual connection to the core mission of the project.

  **Color Palette**: The color scheme was carefully selected to provide consistency and relevance to the cause:
  - **Primary Color**: Purple (to represent domestic violence awareness)
  - **Other Colors**: A well-defined set of complementary colors for design harmony. You can view the full palette and fonts [here](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=24021c-fffbf6-BC67CB-F5B8C8-9533EB&fonts=Inter-Inter).

  **Typography**: The design prioritizes readability with a good balance of headings and body text.

  **Responsive Design**: The website will be fully responsive to ensure it adapts seamlessly to different devices, providing a pleasant user experience.

- **Brochure Design**: To further promote the cause, the brochure design follows the same color palette as the website for consistency.
